description: Verify PR readiness with local QA and branch policy.
---

Confirm the current branch is **not** `main` unless explicitly documented as an exception.
Run the full `/qa` sequence via `qa-gatekeeper` (FROM/TAG lockstep included). Report whether
pushing/opening a PR is allowed, with blockers. Direct pushes to `main` are forbidden. Do
not edit files, push, or open PRs.
